# AHMS-SED
Atmospheric and Hydrological-Sediment Modelling System (AHMS-SED)
The Atmospheric and Hydrological-Sediment Modelling System (AHMS-SED) is developed by incorporating a water erosion and sediment transport module in AHMS (Jiang et al., 2022; Xia, 2019). Specifically, the water erosion and sediment transport model of CASC2D-SED (Rojas et al., 2003) is modified and incorporated into the AHMS. This modelling system accounts for irrigation and has been shown to accurately reproduce the observations on a broad range of hydrological processes at Yellow River Basin â€“ including water budget, evapotranspiration, terrestrial water storage changes, and streamflow in this basin (Jiang et al., 2022). The coupled AHMS-SED then provides the capability to estimate the watershed or continental scale sediment discharge while considering gully erosion. Figure 3 shows the flowchart of the water erosion and sediment transport module coupled within the large-scale hydrological model.
